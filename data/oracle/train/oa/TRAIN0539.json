Each slot in the grid has a unique identifier:\n    - Top row: [A1] [A2] [A3]\n    - Middle row: [B1] [B2] [B3]\n    - Bottom row: [C1] [C2] [C3]\n\nThe output of the crafting process is placed in a designated output slot labeled [0] You cannot move or smelt items directly into slot [0]\n\nInventory Slots: The remaining inventory slots (outside of the crafting grid) are used for storing items. These slots are labeled as [I1] to [I36]\n\nActions:\n\t- move: Transfer a specific quantity of an item from one slot to another\n\t- smelt: Smelt an item in a furnace and moves the output to a specific slot\n\nFormat\n\t- `move: from [Source] to [Target] with quantity N`\n\t- `smelt: from [Source] to [Target] with quantity N`\n\nExample:\n    - `move: from [I2] to [A1] with quantity 3`\n    - `smelt: from [I5] to [I6] with quantity 1`\n\nConstraints:\n   - You cannot move or smelt items into [0]\n   - If an item is not in slot [0] then the recipe is incorrect\n   - You need to move items from [0] to a free inventory slot to complete the crafting process"

These slots are labeled as [I1] to [I36]\n\nActions:\n\t- move: Transfer a specific quantity of an item from one slot to another\n\t- smelt: Smelt an item in a furnace and moves the output to a specific slot\n\nFormat\n\t- `move: from [Source] to [Target] with quantity N`\n\t- `smelt: from [Source] to [Target] with quantity N`\n\nExample:\n    - `move: from [I2] to [A1] with quantity 3`\n    - `smelt: from [I5] to [I6] with quantity 1`\n\nConstraints:\n   - You cannot move or smelt items into [0]\n   - If an item is not in slot [0] then the recipe is incorrect\n   - You need to move items from [0] to a free inventory slot to complete the crafting process"

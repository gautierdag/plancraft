Human: How to obtain iron_pickaxe?
AI: The code for obtaining iron_pickaxe is as follows:
def obtain_iron_pickaxe(inventory = {}):
    mine({'iron_ore':1}, null); # action 1: mine 1 iron_ore without tool
    smelt({'iron_ingot':1}, {'iron_ore':1}, furnace); # action 2: smelt 1 iron_ingot from 1 iron_ore, with furnace 
    craft({'iron_pickaxe':1}, {'iron_ingot':3, 'stick':2}, null); # action 3: craft 1 iron_pickaxe from 3 iron_ingot and 2 stick
    return 'iron_pickaxe'
Human: I fail on step 1 "mine({'iron_ore':1}, null);" 
Human: My inventory now has ,
AI: Because mine iron_ore need to use the tool stone_pickaxe, but my inventory does not have stone_pickaxe. So I need to craft stone_pickaxe first.
